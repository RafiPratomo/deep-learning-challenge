# Charity Donation Predictor

This project utilizes a deep learning model to predict the success of charity donation applications based on provided features. The model is built using Python, TensorFlow, and Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze and preprocess charity donation application data, build a neural network model to predict the success of the applications, and evaluate the model's performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `charity_data.csv`, which contains information about charity donation applications. The dataset includes various features such as application type, classification, and status.

## Files

- `charity_data.csv`: The dataset containing charity donation application information.
- `Starter_Code.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation steps.
- `AlphabetSoupCharity.keras`: The trained model saved in leras format.
